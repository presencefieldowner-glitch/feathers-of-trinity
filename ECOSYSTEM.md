# Presence Technology Ecosystem

Long-term vision map for the platform, credited to Joseph Michael Rounsaville. This is the same
kind of document as the original architecture tree in `README.md` — it names where the platform is
headed, not what currently runs. Each branch below is marked with what actually exists in this
repository today versus what is aspirational naming for future work.

Status legend:
- **implemented** — real, tested logic behind it.
- **partial** — some sub-components are real; the rest are scaffolded or vision.
- **scaffolded** — every sub-component has a placeholder in `ecosystem/` that explicitly raises
  `NotImplementedError`. Nothing works yet; the structure exists so real work has somewhere to go.
- **vision** — naming only, no code location yet.

## What "implemented" means here

Only **Runtime Services** has real, tested code behind it, and it's a direct extension of the
existing `core/runtime-kernel` package — not a new component. Each item under it is a small,
framework-agnostic TypeScript class with unit tests in `core/runtime-kernel/tests/`:

- `Router` is an in-process method+path dispatcher, not a production API gateway (no auth, TLS,
  rate limiting, or transport of its own).
- `WorkflowEngine` topologically sorts named steps by `dependsOn` and runs them in order, the same
  cycle/unknown-dependency detection pattern as `RuntimeKernel`'s module ordering.
- `PluginRuntime` is a named-plugin registry that applies every registered plugin to a caller-
  supplied context.
- `Telemetry` is an in-memory counter/gauge store; `Diagnostics` runs a set of named health-check
  functions and aggregates pass/fail.

**Presence Engine** is marked "partial" because `presence/` (see its own `README.md`) prototypes
two of its ten listed pieces — `Presence Runtime`-style signal aggregation (`PresenceEngine`) and
something in the shape of an `Intent Engine` (`StateManager`'s intent gating) — as real, if
intentionally simple, code. The remaining eight pieces live in
`ecosystem/presence_engine_extended.py` as explicit placeholders (see below), and everything under
`presence/src/quantum/` and `presence/src/daas/` is explicitly classical/mock simulation per that
directory's docs — not "Reality Engine," "Spatial Intelligence," or "Physical Presence" in any
literal sense.

## What "scaffolded" means here

Every other branch — LakeTiticaca Interpreter, SAGE Framework, Quantum Audio, the Intelligence
Layer, Visualization, Security, Developer Platform, and Presence OS — has a corresponding module in
the standalone `ecosystem/` Python package (`ecosystem/README.md`), one class per branch with one
method per sub-component named above. **Every one of those methods raises `NotImplementedError`,
enforced by `ecosystem/tests/test_scaffold.py`.** This gives the full tree a 1:1 code location
without claiming any of it does real work — it's a directory structure and a naming contract, not a
functioning reasoning engine, math library, audio pipeline, AI layer, renderer, security system, or
dev-tooling suite.

## Security disclaimer

The **Security** branch (Presence Security, Tokey Token, Identity, Authentication, Encryption,
Trust Engine, Audit Layer) is scaffolded in `ecosystem/security.py` as `SecurityScaffold` — every
method there raises `NotImplementedError` and performs no real cryptography, identity verification,
authentication, or trust evaluation. The only real authentication in this repository is the
standard JWT-based auth already documented in `CLAUDE.md` under `services/api`'s auth module.
Nothing under this branch should be read as, or wired into anything expecting, a working encryption,
identity, or trust system. If it's ever implemented for real, it needs its own security review
first.

## Hardware-adjacent items

Drone Operations and Satellite View (`Visualization`) and Robotics, XR, and Distributed Presence
Network (`Presence OS`) name physical or networked systems this repository has no connection to.
Their placeholders in `ecosystem/visualization.py` and `ecosystem/presence_os.py` are handled
identically to every other scaffolded item — they raise `NotImplementedError` rather than
simulating hardware or a network that doesn't exist here.
